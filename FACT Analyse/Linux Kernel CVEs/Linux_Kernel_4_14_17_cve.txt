1	CVE-2019-16995	772		DoS	2019-09-30	2019-10-04	7.8	None	Remote	Low	Not required	None	None	Complete	In the Linux kernel before 5.0.3, a memory leak exits in hsr_dev_finalize() in net/hsr/hsr_device.c if hsr_add_port fails to add a port, which may cause denial of service, aka CID-6caabe7f197d.
2	CVE-2019-16994	772		DoS	2019-09-30	2019-10-04	7.8	None	Remote	Low	Not required	None	None	Complete	In the Linux kernel before 5.0, a memory leak exists in sit_init_net() in net/ipv6/sit.c when register_netdev() fails to register sitn->fb_tunnel_dev, which may cause denial of service, aka CID-07f12b26e21a.
3	CVE-2019-15916	119		DoS Overflow	2019-09-04	2019-10-04	7.8	None	Remote	Low	Not required	None	None	Complete	An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.0.1. There is a memory leak in register_queue_kobjects() in net/core/net-sysfs.c, which will cause denial of service.
4	CVE-2019-15807	399		DoS	2019-08-29	2019-09-14	7.8	None	Remote	Low	Not required	None	None	Complete	In the Linux kernel before 5.1.13, there is a memory leak in drivers/scsi/libsas/sas_expander.c when SAS expander discovery fails. This will cause a BUG and denial of service.
5	CVE-2019-15666	125		DoS	2019-08-27	2019-09-14	7.8	None	Remote	Low	Not required	None	None	Complete	An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.0.19. There is an out-of-bounds array access in __xfrm_policy_unlink, which will cause denial of service, because verify_newpolicy_info in net/xfrm/xfrm_user.c mishandles directory validation.
6	CVE-2019-14816	120		DoS Exec Code Overflow	2019-09-20	2019-09-24	7.2	None	Local	Low	Not required	Complete	Complete	Complete	There is heap-based buffer overflow in kernel, all versions up to, excluding 5.3, in the marvell wifi chip driver in Linux kernel, that allows local users to cause a denial of service(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.
7	CVE-2019-14814	120		DoS Exec Code Overflow	2019-09-20	2019-09-24	7.2	None	Local	Low	Not required	Complete	Complete	Complete	There is heap-based buffer overflow in Linux kernel, all versions up to, excluding 5.3, in the marvell wifi chip driver in Linux kernel, that allows local users to cause a denial of service(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.
8	CVE-2019-11810	476		DoS	2019-05-07	2019-06-07	7.8	None	Remote	Low	Not required	None	None	Complete	An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.0.7. A NULL pointer dereference can occur when megasas_create_frame_pool() fails in megasas_alloc_cmds() in drivers/scsi/megaraid/megaraid_sas_base.c. This causes a Denial of Service, related to a use-after-free.
9	CVE-2019-11477	190		DoS Overflow	2019-06-18	2019-06-20	7.8	None	Remote	Low	Not required	None	None	Complete	Jonathan Looney discovered that the TCP_SKB_CB(skb)->tcp_gso_segs value was subject to an integer overflow in the Linux kernel when handling TCP Selective Acknowledgments (SACKs). A remote attacker could use this to cause a denial of service. This has been fixed in stable kernel releases 4.4.182, 4.9.182, 4.14.127, 4.19.52, 5.1.11, and is fixed in commit 3b4929f65b0d8249f19a50245cd88ed1a2f78cff.
10	CVE-2018-20961	415		DoS	2019-08-07	2019-08-27	10.0	None	Remote	Low	Not required	Complete	Complete	Complete	In the Linux kernel before 4.16.4, a double free vulnerability in the f_midi_set_alt function of drivers/usb/gadget/function/f_midi.c in the f_midi driver may allow attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified other impact.
11	CVE-2018-20784	400		DoS	2019-02-22	2019-07-30	7.5	None	Remote	Low	Not required	Partial	Partial	Partial	In the Linux kernel before 4.20.2, kernel/sched/fair.c mishandles leaf cfs_rq's, which allows attackers to cause a denial of service (infinite loop in update_blocked_averages) or possibly have unspecified other impact by inducing a high load.
12	CVE-2018-10880	787		DoS	2018-07-25	2019-04-01	7.1	None	Remote	Medium	Not required	None	None	Complete	Linux kernel is vulnerable to a stack-out-of-bounds write in the ext4 filesystem code when mounting and writing to a crafted ext4 image in ext4_update_inline_data(). An attacker could use this to cause a system crash and a denial of service.
13	CVE-2018-6555	416		DoS	2018-09-04	2019-10-09	7.2	None	Local	Low	Not required	Complete	Complete	Complete	The irda_setsockopt function in net/irda/af_irda.c and later in drivers/staging/irda/net/af_irda.c in the Linux kernel before 4.17 allows local users to cause a denial of service (ias_object use-after-free and system crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via an AF_IRDA socket.
14	CVE-2018-5390	20		DoS	2018-08-06	2019-06-28	7.8	None	Remote	Low	Not required	None	None	Complete	Linux kernel versions 4.9+ can be forced to make very expensive calls to tcp_collapse_ofo_queue() and tcp_prune_ofo_queue() for every incoming packet which can lead to a denial of service.
