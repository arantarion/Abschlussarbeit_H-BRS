A privileged guest user able to pass descriptors with invalid length to the host when migration is underway, could use this flaw to increase their privileges on the host.
15	CVE-2019-14816	120		DoS Exec Code Overflow	2019-09-20	2019-09-24	7.2	None	Local	Low	Not required	Complete	Complete	Complete	There is heap-based buffer overflow in kernel, all versions up to, excluding 5.3, in the marvell wifi chip driver in Linux kernel, that allows local users to cause a denial of service(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.

17	CVE-2019-13272	264			2019-07-17	2019-07-25	7.2	None	Local	Low	Not required	Complete	Complete	Complete	In the Linux kernel before 5.1.17, ptrace_link in kernel/ptrace.c mishandles the recording of the credentials of a process that wants to create a ptrace relationship, which allows local users to obtain root access by leveraging certain scenarios with a parent-child process relationship, where a parent drops privileges and calls execve (potentially allowing control by an attacker). One contributing factor is an object lifetime issue (which can also cause a panic). Another contributing factor is incorrect marking of a ptrace relationship as privileged, which is exploitable through (for example) Polkit's pkexec helper with PTRACE_TRACEME. NOTE: SELinux deny_ptrace might be a usable workaround in some environments.

There is a race condition in smp_task_timedout() and smp_task_done() in drivers/scsi/libsas/sas_expander.c, leading to a use-after-free.
26	CVE-2018-20784	400		DoS	2019-02-22	2019-07-30	7.5	None	Remote	Low	Not required	Partial	Partial	Partial	In the Linux kernel before 4.20.2, kernel/sched/fair.c mishandles leaf cfs_rq's, which allows attackers to cause a denial of service (infinite loop in update_blocked_averages) or possibly have unspecified other impact by inducing a high load.
27	CVE-2018-20169	400			2018-12-17	2019-08-13	7.2	None	Local	Low	Not required	Complete	Complete	Complete	An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 4.19.9. The USB subsystem mishandles size checks during the reading of an extra descriptor, related to __usb_get_extra_descriptor in drivers/usb/core/usb.c.
28	CVE-2018-16882	416		+Priv	2019-01-03	2019-10-09	7.2	None	Local	Low	Not required	Complete	Complete	Complete	A use-after-free issue was found in the way the Linux kernel's KVM hypervisor processed posted interrupts when nested(=1) virtualization is enabled. In nested_get_vmcs12_pages(), in case of an error while processing posted interrupt address, it unmaps the 'pi_desc_page' without resetting 'pi_desc' descriptor address, which is later used in pi_test_and_clear_on(). A guest user/process could use this flaw to crash the host kernel resulting in DoS or potentially gain privileged access to a system. Kernel versions before 4.14.91 and before 4.19.13 are vulnerable.
29	CVE-2018-16276	20			2018-08-31	2019-01-15	7.2	None	Local	Low	Not required	Complete	Complete	Complete	An issue was discovered in yurex_read in drivers/usb/misc/yurex.c in the Linux kernel before 4.17.7.

The "null skcipher" was being dropped when each af_alg_ctx was freed instead of when the aead_tfm was freed. This can cause the null skcipher to be freed while it is still in use leading to a local user being able to crash the system or possibly escalate privileges.
31	CVE-2018-13406	190		Overflow	2018-07-06	2018-08-29	7.2	None	Local	Low	Not required	Complete	Complete	Complete	An integer overflow in the uvesafb_setcmap function in drivers/video/fbdev/uvesafb.c in the Linux kernel before 4.17.4 could result in local attackers being able to crash the kernel or potentially elevate privileges because kmalloc_array is not used.

35	CVE-2018-7480	415		DoS	2018-02-25	2018-05-23	7.2	None	Local	Low	Not required	Complete	Complete	Complete	The blkcg_init_queue function in block/blk-cgroup.c in the Linux kernel before 4.11 allows local users to cause a denial of service (double free) or possibly have unspecified other impact by triggering a creation failure.

37	CVE-2017-1000251	119		Exec Code Overflow	2017-09-12	2018-02-16	8.3	Admin	Local Network	Low	Not required	Complete	Complete	Complete	The native Bluetooth stack in the Linux Kernel (BlueZ), starting at the Linux kernel version 2.6.32 and up to and including 4.13.1, are vulnerable to a stack overflow vulnerability in the processing of L2CAP configuration responses resulting in Remote code execution in kernel space.
38	CVE-2017-18595	415			2019-09-04	2019-10-10	7.2	None	Local	Low	Not required	Complete	Complete	Complete	An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 4.14.11. A double free may be caused by the function allocate_trace_buffer in the file kernel/trace/trace.c.
39	CVE-2017-18509	20		Exec Code	2019-08-13	2019-09-26	7.2	None	Local	Low	Not required	Complete	Complete	Complete	An issue was discovered in net/ipv6/ip6mr.c in the Linux kernel before 4.11. By setting a specific socket option, an attacker can control a pointer in kernel land and cause an inet_csk_listen_stop general protection fault, or potentially execute arbitrary code under certain circumstances. The issue can be triggered as root (e.g., inside a default LXC container or with the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability) or after namespace unsharing. This occurs because sk_type and protocol are not checked in the appropriate part of the ip6_mroute_* functions. NOTE: this affects Linux distributions that use 4.9.x longterm kernels before 4.9.187.
