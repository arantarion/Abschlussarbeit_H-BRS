This affects the Linux kernel 4.9-stable tree, 4.12-stable tree, 3.18-stable tree, and 4.4-stable tree.
52	CVE-2017-7482	190		Mem. Corr.	2018-07-30	2019-10-09	7.2	None	Local	Low	Not required	Complete	Complete	Complete	In the Linux kernel before version 4.12, Kerberos 5 tickets decoded when using the RXRPC keys incorrectly assumes the size of a field.
