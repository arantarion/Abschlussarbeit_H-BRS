A privileged guest user able to pass descriptors with invalid length to the host when migration is underway, could use this flaw to increase their privileges on the host.
15	CVE-2019-14816	120		DoS Exec Code Overflow	2019-09-20	2019-09-24	7.2	None	Local	Low	Not required	Complete	Complete	Complete	There is heap-based buffer overflow in kernel, all versions up to, excluding 5.3, in the marvell wifi chip driver in Linux kernel, that allows local users to cause a denial of service(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.
16	CVE-2019-14814	120		DoS Exec Code Overflow	2019-09-20	2019-09-24	7.2	None	Local	Low	Not required	Complete	Complete	Complete	There is heap-based buffer overflow in Linux kernel, all versions up to, excluding 5.3, in the marvell wifi chip driver in Linux kernel, that allows local users to cause a denial of service(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.
17	CVE-2019-13272	264			2019-07-17	2019-07-25	7.2	None	Local	Low	Not required	Complete	Complete	Complete	In the Linux kernel before 5.1.17, ptrace_link in kernel/ptrace.c mishandles the recording of the credentials of a process that wants to create a ptrace relationship, which allows local users to obtain root access by leveraging certain scenarios with a parent-child process relationship, where a parent drops privileges and calls execve (potentially allowing control by an attacker). One contributing factor is an object lifetime issue (which can also cause a panic). Another contributing factor is incorrect marking of a ptrace relationship as privileged, which is exploitable through (for example) Polkit's pkexec helper with PTRACE_TRACEME. NOTE: SELinux deny_ptrace might be a usable workaround in some environments.
18	CVE-2019-11815	362			2019-05-08	2019-06-07	9.3	None	Remote	Medium	Not required	Complete	Complete	Complete	An issue was discovered in rds_tcp_kill_sock in net/rds/tcp.c in the Linux kernel before 5.0.8. There is a race condition leading to a use-after-free, related to net namespace cleanup.

27	CVE-2018-20169	400			2018-12-17	2019-08-13	7.2	None	Local	Low	Not required	Complete	Complete	Complete	An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 4.19.9. The USB subsystem mishandles size checks during the reading of an extra descriptor, related to __usb_get_extra_descriptor in drivers/usb/core/usb.c.
28	CVE-2018-18445	125			2018-10-17	2019-04-08	7.2	None	Local	Low	Not required	Complete	Complete	Complete	In the Linux kernel 4.14.x, 4.15.x, 4.16.x, 4.17.x, and 4.18.x before 4.18.13, faulty computation of numeric bounds in the BPF verifier permits out-of-bounds memory accesses because adjust_scalar_min_max_vals in kernel/bpf/verifier.c mishandles 32-bit right shifts.
29	CVE-2018-16882	416		+Priv	2019-01-03	2019-10-09	7.2	None	Local	Low	Not required	Complete	Complete	Complete	A use-after-free issue was found in the way the Linux kernel's KVM hypervisor processed posted interrupts when nested(=1) virtualization is enabled. In nested_get_vmcs12_pages(), in case of an error while processing posted interrupt address, it unmaps the 'pi_desc_page' without resetting 'pi_desc' descriptor address, which is later used in pi_test_and_clear_on(). A guest user/process could use this flaw to crash the host kernel resulting in DoS or potentially gain privileged access to a system. Kernel versions before 4.14.91 and before 4.19.13 are vulnerable.
30	CVE-2018-16276	20			2018-08-31	2019-01-15	7.2	None	Local	Low	Not required	Complete	Complete	Complete	An issue was discovered in yurex_read in drivers/usb/misc/yurex.c in the Linux kernel before 4.17.7. Local attackers could use user access read/writes with incorrect bounds checking in the yurex USB driver to crash the kernel or potentially escalate privileges.
31	CVE-2018-14634	190		Overflow	2018-09-25	2018-11-27	7.2	None	Local	Low	Not required	Complete	Complete	Complete	An integer overflow flaw was found in the Linux kernel's create_elf_tables() function. An unprivileged local user with access to SUID (or otherwise privileged) binary could use this flaw to escalate their privileges on the system. Kernel versions 2.6.x, 3.10.x and 4.14.x are believed to be vulnerable.
32	CVE-2018-14633	119		Overflow	2018-09-24	2018-11-27	8.3	None	Remote	Medium	Not required	Partial	Partial	Complete	A security flaw was found in the chap_server_compute_md5() function in the ISCSI target code in the Linux kernel in a way an authentication request from an ISCSI initiator is processed. An unauthenticated remote attacker can cause a stack buffer overflow and smash up to 17 bytes of the stack. The attack requires the iSCSI target to be enabled on the victim host. Depending on how the target's code was built (i.e. depending on a compiler, compile flags and hardware architecture) an attack may lead to a system crash and thus to a denial-of-service or possibly to a non-authorized access to data exported by an iSCSI target. Due to the nature of the flaw, privilege escalation cannot be fully ruled out, although we believe it is highly unlikely. Kernel versions 4.18.x, 4.14.x and 3.10.x are believed to be vulnerable.
33	CVE-2018-14619	20			2018-08-30	2019-10-09	7.2	None	Local	Low	Not required	Complete	Complete	Complete	A flaw was found in the crypto subsystem of the Linux kernel before version kernel-4.15-rc4. The "null skcipher" was being dropped when each af_alg_ctx was freed instead of when the aead_tfm was freed. This can cause the null skcipher to be freed while it is still in use leading to a local user being able to crash the system or possibly escalate privileges.
34	CVE-2018-13406	190		Overflow	2018-07-06	2018-08-29	7.2	None	Local	Low	Not required	Complete	Complete	Complete	An integer overflow in the uvesafb_setcmap function in drivers/video/fbdev/uvesafb.c in the Linux kernel before 4.17.4 could result in local attackers being able to crash the kernel or potentially elevate privileges because kmalloc_array is not used.
35	CVE-2018-10880	787		DoS	2018-07-25	2019-04-01	7.1	None	Remote	Medium	Not required	None	None	Complete	Linux kernel is vulnerable to a stack-out-of-bounds write in the ext4 filesystem code when mounting and writing to a crafted ext4 image in ext4_update_inline_data(). An attacker could use this to cause a system crash and a denial of service.
36	CVE-2018-8781	190		Exec Code Overflow	2018-04-23	2018-10-31	7.2	None	Local	Low	Not required	Complete	Complete	Complete	The udl_fb_mmap function in drivers/gpu/drm/udl/udl_fb.c at the Linux kernel version 3.4 and up to and including 4.15 has an integer-overflow vulnerability allowing local users with access to the udldrmfb driver to obtain full read and write permissions on kernel physical pages, resulting in a code execution in kernel space.
37	CVE-2018-6555	416		DoS	2018-09-04	2019-10-09	7.2	None	Local	Low	Not required	Complete	Complete	Complete	The irda_setsockopt function in net/irda/af_irda.c and later in drivers/staging/irda/net/af_irda.c in the Linux kernel before 4.17 allows local users to cause a denial of service (ias_object use-after-free and system crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via an AF_IRDA socket.
38	CVE-2018-5390	20		DoS	2018-08-06	2019-06-28	7.8	None	Remote	Low	Not required	None	None	Complete	Linux kernel versions 4.9+ can be forced to make very expensive calls to tcp_collapse_ofo_queue() and tcp_prune_ofo_queue() for every incoming packet which can lead to a denial of service.
39	CVE-2018-1068	787			2018-03-16	2019-05-14	7.2	None	Local	Low	Not required	Complete	Complete	Complete	A flaw was found in the Linux 4.x kernel's implementation of 32-bit syscall interface for bridging. This allowed a privileged user to arbitrarily write to a limited range of kernel memory.
