55	CVE-2017-12762	119		Overflow	2017-08-09	2018-04-05	10.0	None	Remote	Low	Not required	Complete	Complete	Complete	In /drivers/isdn/i4l/isdn_net.c: A user-controlled buffer is copied into a local buffer of constant size using strcpy without a length check which can cause a buffer overflow. This affects the Linux kernel 4.9-stable tree, 4.12-stable tree, 3.18-stable tree, and 4.4-stable tree.
56	CVE-2017-8067	119		DoS Overflow Mem. Corr.	2017-04-23	2017-04-27	7.2	None	Local	Low	Not required	Complete	Complete	Complete	drivers/char/virtio_console.c in the Linux kernel 4.9.x and 4.10.x before 4.10.12 interacts incorrectly with the CONFIG_VMAP_STACK option, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (system crash or memory corruption) or possibly have unspecified other impact by leveraging use of more than one virtual page for a DMA scatterlist.
57	CVE-2017-8066	119		DoS Overflow Mem. Corr.	2017-04-23	2017-04-27	7.2	None	Local	Low	Not required	Complete	Complete	Complete	drivers/net/can/usb/gs_usb.c in the Linux kernel 4.9.x and 4.10.x before 4.10.2 interacts incorrectly with the CONFIG_VMAP_STACK option, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (system crash or memory corruption) or possibly have unspecified other impact by leveraging use of more than one virtual page for a DMA scatterlist.
58	CVE-2017-8065	119		DoS Overflow Mem. Corr.	2017-04-23	2017-04-27	7.2	None	Local	Low	Not required	Complete	Complete	Complete	crypto/ccm.c in the Linux kernel 4.9.x and 4.10.x through 4.10.12 interacts incorrectly with the CONFIG_VMAP_STACK option, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (system crash or memory corruption) or possibly have unspecified other impact by leveraging use of more than one virtual page for a DMA scatterlist.
59	CVE-2017-8064	119		DoS Overflow Mem. Corr.	2017-04-23	2017-11-03	7.2	None	Local	Low	Not required	Complete	Complete	Complete	drivers/media/usb/dvb-usb-v2/dvb_usb_core.c in the Linux kernel 4.9.x and 4.10.x before 4.10.12 interacts incorrectly with the CONFIG_VMAP_STACK option, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (system crash or memory corruption) or possibly have unspecified other impact by leveraging use of more than one virtual page for a DMA scatterlist.
60	CVE-2017-8063	119		DoS Overflow	2017-04-23	2017-04-27	7.2	None	Local	Low	Not required	Complete	Complete	Complete	drivers/media/usb/dvb-usb/cxusb.c in the Linux kernel 4.9.x and 4.10.x before 4.10.12 interacts incorrectly with the CONFIG_VMAP_STACK option, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact by leveraging use of more than one virtual page for a DMA scatterlist.
61	CVE-2017-8062	119		DoS Overflow Mem. Corr.	2017-04-23	2017-04-27	7.2	None	Local	Low	Not required	Complete	Complete	Complete	drivers/media/usb/dvb-usb/dw2102.c in the Linux kernel 4.9.x and 4.10.x before 4.10.4 interacts incorrectly with the CONFIG_VMAP_STACK option, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (system crash or memory corruption) or possibly have unspecified other impact by leveraging use of more than one virtual page for a DMA scatterlist.
62	CVE-2017-8061	119		DoS Overflow Mem. Corr.	2017-04-23	2017-04-27	7.2	None	Local	Low	Not required	Complete	Complete	Complete	drivers/media/usb/dvb-usb/dvb-usb-firmware.c in the Linux kernel 4.9.x and 4.10.x before 4.10.7 interacts incorrectly with the CONFIG_VMAP_STACK option, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (system crash or memory corruption) or possibly have unspecified other impact by leveraging use of more than one virtual page for a DMA scatterlist.
63	CVE-2017-7482	190		Mem. Corr.	2018-07-30	2019-10-09	7.2	None	Local	Low	Not required	Complete	Complete	Complete	In the Linux kernel before version 4.12, Kerberos 5 tickets decoded when using the RXRPC keys incorrectly assumes the size of a field. This could lead to the size-remaining variable wrapping and the data pointer going over the end of the buffer. This could possibly lead to memory corruption and possible privilege escalation.
