====== Build a package ======

This page is about how to build a package for an existing OpenWrt distribution without rebuilding the whole world or using the SDK (because it doesn't work on your host system). The instructions come from the forum topic [[https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=29313]]

<code>
git clone https://github.com/openwrt/openwrt.git
./scripts/feeds update
make defconfig
make package/symlinks
</code>

If you get an error at "make defconfig" saying that ncurses.h wasn't found install libncurses5-dev package on your system.

Then copy the config.x86_generic, or whichever you need, from the SDK into .config
<code>
make menuconfig
make menuconfig -> check nano and libncurses
make tools/install
make toolchain/install
make target/compile
./scripts/feeds install owhttpd
make package/owhttpd/prepare
make package/owhttpd/compile
make package/owhttpd/install

make package/index
</code>
