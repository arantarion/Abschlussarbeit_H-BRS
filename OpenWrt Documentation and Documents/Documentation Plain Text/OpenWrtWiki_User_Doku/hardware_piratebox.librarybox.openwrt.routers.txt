====== PirateBox & LibraryBox ======
PirateBox & LibraryBox are special configured OpenWrt Routers. The primary target is to share data, located on USB Stick, with people at the location of the device. PirateBox is the origin of those projects and offers, beside the access on the USB Stick, an upload possibility and a shoutbox.
