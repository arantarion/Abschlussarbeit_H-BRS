====== FAQ after Installation of OpenWrt ======
<WRAP center box 600px>
| {{:meta:icons:tango:dialog-information.png?nolink}} | There is no preset password in OpenWrt!\\ **You need to set a password at your [[docs:guide-quick-start:walkthrough_login|first login]] per telnet or the WebUI.** |
</WRAP>


===== General =====
==== How do I ...? ====
->[[docs:start]]

==== How do I login? ====
-> follow [[docs:guide-quick-start:walkthrough_login]]

==== What version of OpenWrt do I have installed? ====
As you can see here [[about/development]], there are always two branches which are being actively worked on. OpenWrt trunk, which is bleeding edge, codename 'Designated Driver', and the [[:downloads|current stable]] release. Do <code>cat /etc/banner</code> to see the exact revision. Use that information for bug reports and questions in the forum. Also use it, to look up information yourself: [[https://dev.openwrt.org/browser]]

==== I forgot my password! ====
-> [[docs:guide-user:troubleshooting:generic.debrick]]

==== I have no WebUI ====
Install one, e.g. [[docs:guide-user:luci:luci.essentials|LuCI]].

==== How do I use the CLI (command-line interpreter)? ====
-> [[docs:guide-user:base-system:user.beginner.cli]]

==== How do I access the syslog messages? ====
Unless you installed some other log daemons, OpenWrt uses by default busybox-klogd and busybox-syslogd for logging. Both use the same circular buffer, which can be accessed with the command <code>logread</code>

==== How do I recover / boot in failsafe mode? ====
->[[docs:guide-user:troubleshooting:failsafe_and_factory_reset]]

==== I don't like LuCI ====
There are three [[docs:guide-user:luci:webinterface.overview|WebUI]]s available. All are FOSS, thus you can adapt each of them to your specific needs and likings.

===== Installing packages =====
==== How do I install ... ====
-> with ''[[docs:guide-user:additional-software:opkg]]''

==== How do I uninstall ... ====
-> with ''[[docs:guide-user:additional-software:opkg]]''

==== No space left on device ====

see also [[docs:guide-user:additional-software:opkg#out_of_space|OPKG troubleshooting: Out of space]]

=== How do I free up some space? ===
By removing packages you installed //after// flashing OpenWrt onto your Router. You cannot remove packages on the [[docs:techref:flash.layout|SquashFS partition]], which is included in the image you flashed.

=== Still not enough free space ===
This happens easily with recent firmware on 4MB Flash devices.\\
You can press-fit an OpenWrt image into this small flash by building your own image, with only the packages you need, tailored for your usecase.

You can build your own image

  * via [[docs:guide-user:additional-software:imagebuilder|Image Generator]]
  * via [[docs:guide-developer:build-system:start|custom build]]


=== I need many MB (GB) free space ===
  * If you need even more space for package installation, you probably want [[docs:guide-user:additional-software:extroot_configuration|Extroot]].
  * If you just want simple USB storage for e.g. pictures, video, music, see [[docs:guide-user:storage:usb-installing]] and [[docs:guide-user:storage:usb-drives]].

==== Howto install opkg packages on a USB stick? ====
  * →[[docs:guide-user:additional-software:opkg#non-standard_installation_destinations|opkg installation destinations]]
  * →[[docs:guide-user:storage:fstab|/etc/config/fstab]] or →[[docs:guide-user:storage:usb-drives]]

==== Where should I send bug reports? ====
Please send reproducible bugs to our [[http://dev.openwrt.org/report|ticket system]].

==== Is package ... available? ====
**<color green>You can check yourself:</color>**

  - [[packages:table_lede17_1:start|Package table]]
  - The OpenWrt repositories are brows-able by web browser.\\ Examples **for ar71xx** (replace ar71xx with the target fitting to your device):
    * 17.01.4 packages -> [[http://downloads.openwrt.org/releases/17.01.4/targets/ar71xx/generic/packages/]]
    * snapshot packages -> [[http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/targets/ar71xx/generic/packages/]]



==== Why isn't package ... available? ====
Possible reasons:
  * it makes no sense to have this software in the repositories, because it is too bloated/not suited for embedded environments
  * nobody has thought on packaging this software for OpenWrt yet

Possible solutions:
  * create the package yourself: [[docs:guide-developer:packages|Creating a package]]
  * do nothing and wait until package becomes available

==== Cannot satisfy dependencies ====

You will get the message //"Cannot satisfy the following dependencies for..."// if you are trying to install packages intended for a trunk build of OpenWrt on a different (older) version, i.e. the package in the trunk repository is for a newer kernel version than the kernel version on your flash.

  * As general advice, especially for inexperienced users: Go for the latest //[[about:history|stable release]]// version, not a trunk version, and the package repositories will match.
  * Try to install via opkg with option ''[[docs:guide-user:additional-software:opkg#options|--force-depends]]'' (=Install/remove despite failed dependencies). Mind that this is likely to fail for kernel related packages (kmods).
  * [[docs:guide-user:advanced:snippets#make_local_copy_of_packages|Make local copy of trunk packages]] (not recommended, needs much space!)

===== Network =====

==== Howto connect behind another router? ====
This scenario: https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=204297#p204297 has three solutions:
  * https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=204332#p204332
  * maybe see [[docs:guide-user:network:wifi:dumbap]]

==== Howto avoid double NATing? ====
see above: Howto connect behind another router?

==== iptables does not work as intended ====
That be because the firewall-package comes with a configuration already. Certain user chains are created, and packets put into them. When you then later try to catch packets in the ''INPUT'' chain, there won't be any, because they are being put into user chains (maybe something like ''wan_input'', ''lan_input'') before that.

Anytime you can type <code>iptables -L </code> to see how things are currently setup, but best thing is, to always know your own setup.

==== How to view dhcp leases from shell ? ====
<code>cat /tmp/dhcp.leases</code>

==== I trashed my /etc/config/firewall file, how to reset? ====
<code bash> cp -f /rom/etc/config/firewall /etc/config/firewall
/etc/init.d/firewall restart</code>

==== How can I filter traffic based on FQDN? ====
  * netfilter
  * HTTP proxy server
  * ipset-dns

==== No ping to external servers ====
==== Internet not reachable ====

Something is wrong with your network configuration. Check Netmask, Gateway, DNS settings.

===== Other questions =====
==== How do I have it do something every YYY seconds/minutes? ====
Like on any Linux system, you can use ''[[wp>cron|crond]]''. Please consult ''[[docs:guide-user:base-system:notuci.config#etccrontabsroot|/etc/crontabs/root]]''

==== How do I create a cronjob to reboot? ====
  * ''Busybox-crond'' does not support the //@reboot// directive. The next best place to put @reboot jobs is ''/etc/rc.local''
  * [[https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=45274]]

==== How do I turn USB power off? ====
