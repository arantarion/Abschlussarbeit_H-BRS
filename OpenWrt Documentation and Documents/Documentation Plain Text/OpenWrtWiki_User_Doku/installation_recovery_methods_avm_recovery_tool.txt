====== AVM recovery tool ======

Many AVM devices can be unbricked by a AVM recovery tool which is specific to your device.

**Example:** For Fritz!Box 7530 [[http://ftp.avm.de/fritzbox/fritzbox-7530/other/recover/]]

Search the corresponding recovery tool for your specific device on the AVM FTP server.

===== Debricking a branded device =====

If you have a branded (e.g. 1&1) AVM device and you get the following message
<code>
The device contains basic settings adapted for your Internet Service Provider
</code>

when trying to go back to OEM firmware via the AVM recovery tool, you have to unbrand your device first. See the procedure below how to do this.

  - Set your PCs IP to 192.168.178.x/24 (where x is not 1) and the default gateway to 192.168.178.1.
  - Turn off your router, ensure your PC is connected to LAN1 via Ethernet, and turn the router back on.
  - Wait for the interface to become active (usually indicated by LEDs on your PC's Ethernet port) and connect to the bootloader's FTP server, e.g. ''ftp -n 192.168.178.1''
  - Then issue the following set of commands:\\ <code>
    quote USER adam2
    quote PASS adam2
    quote SETENV firmware_version avm
    quote UNSETENV provider
    quit
</code> Not sure if it's necessary to change the firmware_version variable.
  - Run the recovery tool, but make sure you **do not reset the device**, otherwise the environment variables will go back to their default values. Even if the recovery tool asks you to power cycle the device, **do not do it**.
