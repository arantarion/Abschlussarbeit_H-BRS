====== Port Forwards ======
This page is a lite version of Port Forwards comparing with that in the usual LuCI interface (Network -> Firewall -> Port Forwards).\\

Port forwarding allows remote computers on the Internet to connect to a specific computer or service within the private LAN.\\

**Attention: **It is not available yet with LuCI interface.\\

This version deletes Source Zone and Destination Zone, on the other hand, a default value was set to them.\\
Source Zone : wan.\\
Destination Zone : lan.

Furthermore, the users don't have to enter a new window to modify a server, that means, they can manipulate on the showing page, which simplifies the use of the interface.\\
