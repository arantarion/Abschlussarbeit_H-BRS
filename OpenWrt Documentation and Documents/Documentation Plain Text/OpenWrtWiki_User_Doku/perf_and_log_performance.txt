====== Performance HowTo ======
Everything, all the hardware components and the software has an effect on the performance of a system as a whole. And there is always a bottleneck, the component that restricts the performance the most. This can be anything: the used protocol (e.g. ftp > nfs > cifs), the used filesystem (e.g. without journaling > bla journaling > full journaling), the Kernel Version, the [[docs:techref:hardware:cpu]], the amount of RAM, the available amount of RAM, the hard disc connection (e.g. eSATA > USB2 > USB1.1 > USB1.0) and so on and so forth.

So if you're talking about ''performance'', you should comprehend what exactly you mean by that and what not! There are <color green>good adequate ways to measure and compare performance</color> and there are <color red>completely useless</color> ones. There are good and useful performance values (e.g. time to zip a file) and completely useless ones (e.g. BogoMIPS).

===== Tests =====

A good program to measure file system performance is ''bonnie++''.
===== Results =====
Since this results are not device specific, but depend on the [[docs:techref:hardware:soc]] or on the [[docs:techref:hardware:cpu]] we collect such centrally to make it easier to compare the results. See [[docs:techref:hardware:performance]]
