''Nodogsplash'' offers a simple way to open a free [[wp>Hotspot (Wi-Fi)]] providing restricted access to an Internet connection.\\
The goal was to use a single wireless router to both provide local secure wifi, and share a portion of our bandwidth as a free hotspot, with a splash page to advertise who is providing the hotspot, and the fact that secure, faster access is available for a small contribution towards costs.

This page describes setting up a simple wireless hotspot with the following features:
  * Open access to the hotspot
  * Capture (splash) page
  * Port restrictions
  * Bandwidth Limit
  * Separate, secure wireless access for local use

The secure wireless is bridged to the hard-wired ports, the hotspot is separate and isolated from the local network.

Official documentation: https://nodogsplashdocs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/

===== Overview =====

The nodogsplash captive portal runs as a service that manages client traffic over a router by adjusting firewall rules based on client tracking tools that interact with a users browser and client network requests.

In order to fully setup user and password authentication or more complex configuration. You will need to read the linked documentation to gain better understanding of the layers that are involved.

Usually this will require some basic script/web source editing and web server setup and modification. On Openwrt if user credentials are to be local to the router this will also need to be considered.
 

===== Installation =====
[[docs:guide-user:additional-software:opkg]]
<code>
opkg update
opkg install nodogsplash
</code>

In **/etc/config/nodogsplash** ensure option enabled is 1
<code>
  option enabled 1
</code>

Enable and start the nodogsplash ( NDS ) service.
<code>
/etc/init.d/nodogsplash enable
/etc/init.d/nodogsplash start
</code>

Some useful commands are listed below.
<code>
/usr/bin/ndsctl status                 ( check if nodogsplash is up )
/usr/bin/ndsctl clients                ( list connected clients and status )
/usr/bin/ndsctl deauth 192.168.1.10    ( useful for testing )
</code>

See https://github.com/nodogsplash/nodogsplash#7-debugging-nodogsplash about how to debug start-up issues.

Documentation can be found online [[https://nodogsplash.readthedocs.io/en/latest/|here]].

===== Configuration =====

==== Nodogsplash Configuration File ====

Older versions use ''/etc/nodogsplash/nodogsplash.conf'', while versions starting at 0.9_beta9.9.9-5 in Chaos Calmer 15.05 use UCI with ''/etc/config/nodogsplash''.

The "/etc/config/nodogsplash" config file can be seen [[https://github.com/openwrt-routing/packages/blob/master/nodogsplash/files/nodogsplash.config|here]] or [[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nodogsplash/nodogsplash/master/openwrt/nodogsplash/files/etc/config/nodogsplash|here]], and is documented below.

Below is a documented version of the "/etc/config/nodogsplash" file. This UCI file is automatically turned into a temporary config file with the old format when nodogsplash starts. That file can be viewed in /tmp/etc/. 

<code>
config nodogsplash
  # Set to 1 to enable nodogsplash
  option enabled 0

  # Use plain configuration file
  #option config '/etc/nodogsplash/nodogsplash.conf'

  # The network the users are connected to - if you connect to 'br-lan', enter 'lan' here.
  option network 'lan'
  
  # Set GatewayName to the name of your gateway. This value
  # will be available as variable $gatewayname in the splash page source
  # and in status output from ndsctl, but otherwise doesn't matter.
  # If none is supplied, the value "NoDogSplash" is used.
  option gatewayname 'OpenWrt Nodogsplash'
  
  # Set MaxClients to the maximum number of users allowed to
  # connect at any time. (Does not include users on the TrustedMACList,
  # who do not authenticate.)

  # or if it exists but contains no FirewallRules.
  #
  # The possible values of an EmptyRuleSetPolicy are:

  #
  # Default EmptyRuleSetPolicies are set as follows:
  # EmptyRuleSetPolicy authenticated-users passthrough
  # EmptyRuleSetPolicy preauthenticated-users block
  # EmptyRuleSetPolicy users-to-router block
  # EmptyRuleSetPolicy trusted-users allow
  # EmptyRuleSetPolicy trusted-users-to-router allow

  # This should be autodetected on an OpenWRT system, but if not:
  # Set GatewayAddress to the IP address of the router on
  # the GatewayInterface. This is the address that the Nodogsplash
  # server listens on.
  # option gatewayaddress '192.168.1.1'

  # This should be autodetected from /proc/net/route on a OpenWRT system, but if

  # After authentication, normally a user is redirected
  # to their initially requested page.
  # If RedirectURL is set, the user is redirected to this URL instead.
  # option redirecturl 'http://www.ilesansfil.org/'

  # Nodogsplash's own http server uses GatewayAddress as its IP address.

</code>


Allow access to email:

<code>
  list authenticated_users 'allow tcp port 995'
  list authenticated_users 'allow tcp port 993'
  list authenticated_users 'allow tcp port 465'
  list authenticated_users 'allow tcp port 110'
  list authenticated_users 'allow tcp port 143'
</code>


Restrict access to the gateway from the hotspot side:
<code>
  list users_to_router 'allow tcp port 22'
  list users_to_router 'allow tcp port 80'
  list users_to_router 'allow tcp port 443'
</code>

==== mwan3 Compatibility ====

NDS and mwan3 both mess with iptables. As such they need a little extra configuration sometimes to work together.

**NDS 0.9** 

Add the following lines to /etc/nodogsplash/nodogsplash.conf:
<code>
FW_MARK_AUTHENTICATED 262144
FW_MARK_TRUSTED 131072
FW_MARK_BLOCKED 65536
</code>

**NDS 1.0**

Make the following changes per [[https://github.com/nodogsplash/nodogsplash/issues/218|this]] issue.

In /etc/config/nodogsplash:
<code>
list fw_mark_authenticated '30000'
list fw_mark_trusted '20000'
list fw_mark_blocked '10000'
</code>

In /etc/config/mwan3:
<code>
config globals 'globals'
</code>

**NDS 2.0**
//(compatible by default)//

==== Check status ====

Nodogsplash package provides the ''ndsctl'' binary to manage it. Run ndsctl without arguments to see the help.

<code>
root@openWrt:~# ndsctl       
Usage: ndsctl [options] command [arguments]

options:
  -s <path>           Path to the socket
  -h                  Print usage

commands:
  status              View the status of nodogsplash
  clients             Display machine-readable client list
  json             	  Display machine-readable client list in json format
  stop                Stop the running nodogsplash
  auth mac|ip|token   Authenticate user with specified mac, ip or token
  deauth mac|ip|token Deauthenticate user with specified mac, ip or token
  block mac           Block the given MAC address
  unblock mac         Unblock the given MAC address
  allow mac           Allow the given MAC address
  unallow mac         Unallow the given MAC address
  trust mac           Trust the given MAC address
  untrust mac         Untrust the given MAC address
  loglevel n          Set logging level to n
  password pass       Set gateway password
  username name       Set gateway username

</code>


===== Customise splash page =====
Edit these files to customize the "splash page" / "error page":

  * ''/etc/nodogsplash/htdocs/splash.html''
  * ''/etc/nodogsplash/htdocs/infoskel.html''

Note, to include an external ''*.css'' file, put it in the images directory, and include as so:

<code>
@import url("$imagesdir/stylesheet.css");
</code>


Somewhere in ''splash.html'' you should include a link for the authentication, e.g:

<code html>
<h3> Click <a href="$authtarget"> HERE</a> to start browsing </h3>
</code>


===== Restrict access to domains =====
If you would want to restrict the access to the IP address 20.20.20.20 you can use this [[docs:guide-user:firewall:netfilter-iptables:netfilter]] command (supposing 10.20.30.0/24 is your hotspot network and you redirect clients to your nodogsplash webserver)

<code>
  iptables -t nat -I ndsOUT -p tcp -s 10.20.30.0/24 -d 20.20.20.20 --dport 80 -j DNAT --to 10.20.30.1:2050
</code>


==== Restrict access to multiple domains ====
Some domains resolve to multiple different ip addresses so you need to ban all of them.
  - Create ''/root/banned.txt'' with the domains to ban (do not add domains with www):<code>
root@openWrt:~# head /root/banned.txt 
alice.cc
malware.ru
sersnkis.com
superdupertorrent.com
ultraload.com
downloadmuch.com
</code>
  - Create following script ''/root/ban-domains.sh'':<code bash>
#!/bin/sh

for domain in `cat /root/banned.txt`; do
	dig @8.8.8.8 $domain | egrep [0-9] | grep IN| awk {'print $5'} >> /tmp/ips.txt
	done

for ip in `cat /tmp/ips.txt`; do
	iptables -t nat -I ndsOUT -p tcp -s 10.20.30.0/24 -d $ip --dport 80 -j DNAT --to 10.20.30.1:80
	done

rm -fr /tmp/ips.txt
</code>
  - run <code>
chmod +x /root/ban-domains.sh"
</code>
  - install dig package: <code>opkg install bind-dig</code>
  - add ''/root/ban-domains.sh'' to your ''/etc/rc.local'' file.

after executing the script you can check if it works ok running "iptables -t nat -L -n" and you should get something like this:

<code>
Chain ndsOUT (1 references)
target     prot opt source               destination         
DNAT       tcp  --  10.20.30.0/24        199.58.211.41       tcp dpt:80 to:10.20.30.1:80 
DNAT       tcp  --  10.20.30.0/24        69.163.39.214       tcp dpt:80 to:10.20.30.1:80 
DNAT       tcp  --  10.20.30.0/24        78.140.135.6        tcp dpt:80 to:10.20.30.1:80 
DNAT       tcp  --  10.20.30.0/24        74.117.114.96       tcp dpt:80 to:10.20.30.1:80 
DNAT       tcp  --  10.20.30.0/24        88.85.73.158        tcp dpt:80 to:10.20.30.1:80 
DNAT       tcp  --  10.20.30.0/24        216.69.227.108      tcp dpt:80 to:10.20.30.1:80 
DNAT       tcp  --  10.20.30.0/24        72.8.129.153        tcp dpt:80 to:10.20.30.1:80 
</code>

==== Restrict access to DNS VPNs ====

The default config opens TCP and UDP port 53 without redirecting it to a DNS server, and this could be exploited with iodine or any VPN software by using those ports. Limit it by changing:

<code>
  #list preauthenticated_users 'allow tcp port 53'
  list preauthenticated_users 'allow udp port 53 to 208.67.222.222'
  list preauthenticated_users 'allow udp port 53 to 208.67.220.220'
</code>

In your /etc/config/nodogsplash file, and change the DNS for ones you use.

  * [[https://github.com/nodogsplash/nodogsplash|Current Nodogsplash source repository]]
  * [[https://github.com/openwrt-routing/packages|Nodogsplash OpenWrt package]]

====== Misc. ======
If your configuration does NOT use NAT, you need to check "force connection tracking" in the firewall configuration of the zone nodogsplash is handling. Without connection tracking, the NAT tables of will not run and redirecting to the splash page does not work.

===== NoDogSplash on OpenWRT 12.09+ Access Point =====

The following instructions are touching NoDogSplash configuration on the OpenWRT 12.09 and later firmwares with "router" configured as a **switch** or **Access Point** (AP). OpenWrt is not configured as a router here! This is a common setup where users want to add additional AP to extend their home WiFi coverage and do not want to mess with router from their Internet providers.
Example setup:
  *  Non OpenWRT router for intranet with address 192.168.1.1
  *  OpenWRT AP with static address 192.168.1.3
  *  Clients get DHCP subnet range 192.168.1.200-250 by router
  *  Clients can connect to AP WiFi within secure SSID
  *  Guest hotspot SSID are getting their own 192.168.15.0/24 subnet and DHCP on isolated segment

Configuration of the AP is as usual except that AP needs to have NAT for the hotspot segment only. To achieve this one needs to add custom iptables rule
  iptables -A POSTROUTING -t nat -j SNAT --to-source 192.168.1.3
and delete all provided firewall rules fy using OpenWRT web interface.

Detailed configuration for AP only OpenWRT is:
  - Install package //nodogsplash//
  - With web interface //Network->WiFi// create: additional ESSID named hotstpot and create additional network hotstpot along with existing lan and unused wan.
  - Edit //Network->Interfaces->HOTSPOT// and select Protocol: Static address with IPv4 address 192.168.5.1 and Netmask: 255.255.255.0. Leave gateway, broadcast and DNS servers empty. Add DHCP server for this interface with default settings. This HOTSPOT interface is internally named as wlan0-1 and will be used as NoDogSplash gateway address.
  - Edit //Network->DHCP and DNS//-Forwarder by unchecking Authoritative and add DNS forwardings: 192.168.1.1 to router DNS masquerading and/or external DNS servers from your internet provider.
  - Remove all //Network->Firewall Zones// and add //Network->Firewall->Custom Rules// by adding iptables rule described above.
  - Change ''/etc/nodogsplash/nodogsplash.conf'' affected lines to

          GatewayInterface wlan0-1
          ExternalInterface br-lan

FirewallRuleSet authenticated-users can remain unchanged. You can also start iptables SNAT command manually if not rebooted meanwhile. Check the presence of this rule by ''iptables -t nat -v -n -L''. Enable and start NoDogSplash. After above setup everything should work. Trafic shapping due to the lack of IMQ currently does not work on OpenWrt 12.09 (Attitude Adjustment).  One possibility is to install qos-scripts and luci-app-qos. Adding additional interface HOTSPOT to QOS configuration cannot separate between WAN and HOTSPOT bandwidth limit. One can choose to limit NoDogSplash and secure WiFi together to certain Upload and Download rate, but not separate!

**Added by NetoMX (2016/03/30): In my case, I needed to add in the default firewall rules, FORWARD->ACCEPT to make this work. I didn't make point 4 and it still works. For bandwitdh limit, use WShaper.

==== Legacy NDS - Bandwidth Control ====

In backfire 10.03.1rc5, you need to edit /etc/init.d/nodogsplash and uncomment last lines to make bandwidth control to work**

<code>
    # if not using traffic control,
    # you can comment out the following 3 lines:
    do_module_tests "imq" "numdevs=2"
    do_module_tests "ipt_IMQ"
    do_module_tests "sch_htb"
</code>
Note: //ipt_IMQ = xt_IMQ//

**You also need to install some extra kernel modules:**

<code>
    opkg install iptables-mod-imq
    opkg install kmod-ipt-imq
    opkg install kmod-sched
</code>
And some utilities
<code>
    opkg install ip
    opkg install tc
</code>

NOTE: In Attitude Adjustment 12.09 there is no ''iptables-mod-imq'' package and so traffic control no longer works.

For bandwidth control in **Attitude Adjustment 12.09** you can install [[http://lartc.org/wondershaper/|WonderShaper]] (which also uses [[docs:guide-user:network:traffic-shaping:packet.scheduler|tc]] as its back-end):

<code>
    opkg install wshaper
</code>

WonderShaper's UCI config file is stored in ''/etc/config/wshaper''. A simple configuration for a guest network might look like this:

<code>
config wshaper 'settings'
	option network 'public'
	option downlink '64'
	option uplink '512'
</code>

**Note:** The ''downlink'' and ''uplink'' maximum values will usually need to be reversed from what one might, at first glance, expect. Also note that due to overhead, actual speeds will be slightly lower.
