| ctorrent  |  dnh3.3.2-5  |  uclibcxx, libopenssl  |  86.767 | [[wp>CTorrent]] is a BitTorrent client written in the C programming language, known to be a very robust and mature programming language, which produces fast and optimized application. This package is built with OpenSSL support. |
| ctorrent-nossl  |  dnh3.3.2-5  |  uclibcxx  |  86.720 | CTorrent is a BitTorrent client written in the C programming language, known to be a very robust and mature programming language, which produces fast and optimized application.

| deluge*   |                 |                 |            | [[wp>Deluge (software)|Deluge]] is written in Python and should be available since [[https://dev.openwrt.org/changeset/20178|R20178]].\\ Deluge is broken in OpenWrt: [[https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/6888|6888]] deluge needs rblibtorrent, which is broken and won't probably be fixed anytime soon\\ https://dev.openwrt.org/browser/packages/net/deluge |
| btpd  |  0.16-2  |              |    | BTPD is a bittorrent client consisting of a daemon and client commands, which can be used to read and/or manipulate the daemon state. The daemon is capable of running several torrents simultaneously and only uses one tcp port. It's fairly low on resource usage and should be perfect for file distribution sites. Efficient downloads and ease of use makes this client a good choice for the casual user as well. |
