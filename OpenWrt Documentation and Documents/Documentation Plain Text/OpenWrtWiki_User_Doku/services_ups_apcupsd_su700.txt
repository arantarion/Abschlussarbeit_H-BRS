====== APC SmartUps SU-700 - Linksys EA3500 - LuCI graphs ======
This describes how to connect an APC SmartUps SU-700 via USB on a Linksys EA3500 router. 
This includes collecting the data, and displaying graphs.

  * Plug in UPS
  * Connect a 940-0024 serial cable to the UPS (I'm using a 940-0024c. Other 'smart' cables may work as well. See: [[http://www.apcupsd.org/manual/manual.html#cables]])
  * Connect other end of the cable to a serial-to-usb converter 
    * Some converters work, some don't. A cable from eBay called "USB to RS232 Serial 9 Pin DB9 PIN PL2303 Cable Adapter" did not end up working for me, due to Linux driver issues. I ended up using a [[https://www.iogear.com/product/GUC232A]].
  * Connect the serial-to-usb converter to the router USB port (or a USB hub, if you need multiple things plugged into the port).

  * In the router command line or LuCI web pages, install packages: apcupsd, collectd-mod-apcups, and kmod-usb-serial-pl2303
  * For the command line, the commands are:<code>
opkg update
opkg install kmod-usb-serial-pl2303
opkg install apcupsd
opkg install collectd-mod-apcups
</code>
  * On the router command line, verify that the USB driver is installed and working with command and response:<code>
# ls -la /dev/ttyUSB*
crw-------    1 root     root      188,   0 Dec  1 00:29 /dev/ttyUSB0</code>
  * If you don't see a serial port then something is wrong with the driver for the serial-to-usb converter.
  * Resolve this, before proceeding.

  * The next step is to customize the apcupsd config file. Details of the options can be found at http://www.apcupsd.org/manual/manual.html , in the section "Configuration Directive Reference".
  * On the router command line, go to the /etc/apcupsd directory, and edit the config file:<code>
# cd /etc/apcupsd
# vi apcupsd.conf</code>
  * use the dd command to delete all the lines in the file
  * use the i command to set the VI editor into "insert" mode.
  * Copy and paste this text into the editor:<code>
## apcupsd.conf v1.1 ##

</code>
  * type :wq into the editor, to write the new apcupsd.conf, and quit the edit session
  * restart the apcupsd deamon process:<code> 
# /etc/init.d apcupsd restart
</code>
  * Enter the apcaccess command into the command line, and you should get output like this: <code>
# apcaccess
APC      : 001,034,0829
DATE     : 2017-12-01 18:11:01 -0700

MODEL    : Smart-UPS 700 RM
STATUS   : ONLINE 
...</code>
  * Note the STATUS : ONLINE . If you don't have "ONLINE", then something is wrong

  * Reboot the router.

  * In the router web interface, go to Statistics, Graphs, APC UPS
  * You should see the graphs, with data starting on the right side.
  * If not, wait a minute, refresh your browser and you should start to see data being written.

===== Saving the data across Reboots =====
  * By default the collected data will be lost after a reboot of the router. To save the data, you need to put it on an external device, like a USB flash drive. Connecting both the UPS and a flash drive to a USB hub, which is then connected to the router, works fine for me.
  * To put the data on an external device, go to Statistics / Setup / Output plugins / RRDTool ([[http://192.168.1.1/cgi-bin/luci/admin/statistics/collectd/output/rrdtool]]), and change the Storage directory to wherever you want to store your data.

===== Troubleshooting =====
If you don't have APC UPS graphs at this point, here are some things to check:

  - Change the data collection interval to 10 seconds. This is a workaround for the issue reported in: [[https://github.com/collectd/collectd/issues/617]].
    * Go to Statistics / Setup /
    * Change the Data collection interval to 10 seconds
  - Verify that serial communication to the UPS is working - On a PC
    * attach usb converter to PC
    * startup minicom (or equivalent): minicom -D /dev/ttyUSB0
    * ctrl-a, ctrl-z, P, 
    * change port configuration to 2400,8,n,1
    * ctrl-a, ctrl-z, O, Serial Port Setup
    * change port configuration to hardware / software flow control: none
    * type the uppercase letter: Y , and expect the reply SM<code>
Y
SM</code>
    * Note: serial APC UPS commands are documented at: http://networkupstools.org/protocols/apcsmart.html )
  - Verify that serial communication to the UPS is working - On the Router
    * Detach the usb converter from PC , attach to router
    * Install minicom on the router.
    * Use the same minicom commands to verify communication with the router.
    * type the uppercase letter: Y , and expect the reply SM<code>
Y
SM</code>
  - There should be a tab for APC UPS on the General Plugins page at:<code>
http://192.168.1.1/cgi-bin/luci/admin/statistics/collectd/general</code>If not, you may not have the patches that added luci-statistics support for the apcups plugin: [[https://github.com/openwrt/luci/pull/1227]]. The best fix for this is to upgrade to a version that does.
  - /var/etc/collectd.conf should have a section for apcups:<code>
LoadPlugin apcups
 <Plugin apcups>
  Host localhost
  Port "3551"
 </Plugin></code>If it does not, you can regenerate /var/etc/collectd.conf with this command:<code>
/usr/bin/stat-genconfig > /var/etc/collectd.conf</code>

  * If you still don't have APC UPS graphs, you may not have the patches that added luci-statistics support for the apcups plugin: [[https://github.com/openwrt/luci/pull/1227]]. The best fix for this is to upgrade to a version that does.
