====== mountd Configuration ======
FIXME mountd is obsolete.
As of December 2018, this is replaced by "fstools" (which handles block mount with the block binary) and "blockd" (which handles autofs)

The ''/etc/config/mountd'' configuration is provided by the //mountd// package.
The ''mountd'' configuration file defines parameters for the OpenWrt automount daemon, a small programm that will automount USB storage devices.

===== Sections =====
The configuration file consists of a section defining the mountd options.

=== mountd ====
The ''mountd'' section defines general daemon options.
This is the default configuration for this section:

<code bash>
config 'mountd' 'mountd'
    option 'timeout' '60'
    option 'path' '/tmp/mounts/'
</code>

The ''mountd'' section contains these settings:
^ Name ^ Type ^ Required ^ Default ^ Description ^
| ''timeout'' | integer | | | |
| ''path'' | string | | | |
