=====Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)=====
<WRAP center round important 60%>
Windows Subsystem for Linux is NOT OFFICIALLY supported.
</WRAP>
====Install====
**WSL 1** [[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10| Install/Enable WSL]] \\
or \\
**WSL 2 (preferred)** [[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/wsl2-install|Install/Enable WSL2]] \\
WSL 2 is only available in ''Windows 10 builds 18917'' or higher. It has been reported that [[https://forum.openwrt.org/t/can-images-be-built-using-wsl2/|OpenWrt Image Build on WSL2]] works fine and shows a good performance.

====Configuration====
Remove the entry of the Windows ''%PATH'' variable in your linux distribution. In any distribution create ''/etc/wsl.conf'' and add <code bash>[interop]
appendWindowsPath = false</code> AND/OR \\ \\ Open the windows registry and ''HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Lxss\{GUID}\Flags'' and change the hex value from 7 to 5 ([[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51336147/how-to-remove-the-win10s-path-from-wsl/51345880|Reference StackOverflow]])

You will most likely need to reboot for this change to take effect.  To confirm and check this worked, ``echo $PATH`` in your bash shell and you should see no entries pointing to your Windows directories.  

Follow the standard [[docs:guide-developer:build-system:install-buildsystem|Build system â€“ Setup Linux]] (or the quick start guide here: [[docs:guide-developer:quickstart-build-images|Quick Image Building Guide]] )

It is recommended to compile using a single thread ''make -j1''

[Why? also this contradicts advice on the other page saying to use make -j N where N is number of CPUs + 1]
