====== MPD-full building from source ======
More information about building from source: [[docs:guide-developer:build-system:start|OpenWrt Buildroot - Usage]]

Based on the following reference:\\
[[https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?pid=158385#p158385| Help on compiling MPD full]]\\

If you build from source you will only be able to select the MPD-mini from the make menuconfig interface.\\
To display and enable the full version in the menuconfig interface, you'll have to edit the MPD Makefile.

==== Barrier Breaker and Chaos Calmer ====

  - In your git clone directory edit ''/openwrt/feeds/packages/sound/mpd/Makefile''.\\ It is a good idea to make a backup copy before starting.
  - Detect the area in the Makefile involved with the full MPD installation and edit ''+libffmpeg'' to ''+libffmpeg-full''
  - Save the file

Orignal file:
<code>
  TITLE+= (full)
  DEPENDS+= \
   +AUDIO_SUPPORT:alsa-lib \
   +libaudiofile +BUILD_PATENTED:libfaad2 +libffmpeg +libid3tag \
   +libmms +libogg +libsndfile +libvorbis
  PROVIDES:=mpd
  VARIANT:=full
</code>

Edited file:
<code>
  TITLE+= (full)
  DEPENDS+= \
   +AUDIO_SUPPORT:alsa-lib \
   +libaudiofile +BUILD_PATENTED:libfaad2 +libffmpeg-full +libid3tag \
   [+libmms +libogg +libsndfile +libvorbis 
  PROVIDES:=mpd
  VARIANT:=full
</code>  

Now if you start ''make menuconfig'', you'll have the choice to build the full or the mini MPD version
