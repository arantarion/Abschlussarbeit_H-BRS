====== Networking ======

===== Theory =====

==== Networking... is packet based ====

Information (data) is broken into packets prior to being transported to its destination(s). [[docs:guide-developer:networking:theory|read more...]]

===== Praxis =====

==== Networking in the Linux Kernel ===

Above we read merely about the theory of networking, about the basic ideas, about communication protocols and standards. [[docs:guide-developer:networking:praxis|read more...]]

===== Network Interfaces =====

==== Types of network interfaces ====

GNU/Linux universally distinguishes two types of network interfaces: [[docs:guide-developer:networking:network.interfaces|read more...]] 

===== Applications =====
==== Routing ====

Routing is the process of selecting paths in a network along which to send network traffic. [[docs:guide-user:network:routing|read more...]]

==== Netfilter ====

Well, let's consider what you already know, that data communication, that is, the exchange and transfer of information, or data, takes place in chunks and not as a continuous flow. [[docs:guide-user:firewall:netfilter_iptables:netfilter_openwrt|read more...]] 

You find the sources for this functionality ''[[https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/net/netfilter|/net/netfilter]]''

==== Traffic Control ====
Traffic Control is the umbrella term for packet prioritizing, traffic shaping, bandwidth limiting, AQM (Active Queue Management), etc. [[docs:guide-user:network:traffic-shaping:packet.scheduler|read more...]]

You find the sources for this functionality ''[[https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/net/sched|/net/sched/]]''
