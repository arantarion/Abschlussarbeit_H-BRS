====== Using the SDK ======

THIS IS THE //OLD// DOCUMENT :!:\\

</WRAP>


The [[wp>Software_development_kit|SDK]] is a relocatable, precompiled OpenWrt [[wp>Toolchain|toolchain]] suitable to [[wp>Cross_compile|cross compile]] single [[wp>User_space|userspace]] packages for a specific target without compiling the whole system from scratch.

Reasons for using the SDK are:
  * Compile custom software for a specific release while ensuring binary and feature compatibility
  * Compile newer versions of certain packages
  * Recompile existing packages with custom patches or different features

===== Obtain SDK =====
You can either download an already compiled SDK, or compile it yourself by using the "make menuconfig" command.

=== Prerequisites ===

Please see [[docs:guide-developer:build-system:install-buildsystem|Build system â€“ Installation]] page how to install the needed software to build the packages on the SDK.
----
Note: On some hosts it is needed to install the **ccache** package

==== Download ====
You should find bz2-archives ready for download in the corresponding download directory:

  * [[https://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/| Trunk SDK]] -> [[https://dev.openwrt.org/wiki/platforms| Platform]] -> OpenWrt-SDK-<Platform>-for-linux-x86_64-gcc-<version>-linaro-uClibc-<version>.tar.bz2
  * [[https://downloads.openwrt.org/chaos_calmer/15.05.1/| Stable SDK "Chaos Calmer (15.05.1)"]] -> [[https://dev.openwrt.org/wiki/platforms| Platform]] -> OpenWrt-SDK-<Platform>-for-linux-x86_64-gcc-<version>-linaro-uClibc-<version>.tar.bz2
  * [[https://downloads.openwrt.org/| Legacy SDKs (Historic Releases)]], -> [[https://dev.openwrt.org/wiki/platforms| Platform]] -> OpenWrt-SDK-<Platform>-for-linux-x86_64-gcc-<version>-linaro-uClibc-<version>.tar.bz2

==== Package Feeds ====
After decompressing the SDK archive, edit the ''feeds.conf.default'' file to download the needed package definitions


===== Usage =====
By default the SDK ships with no package definitions.
Makefiles for packages to compile must be checked out from the OpenWrt repository and placed into the ''package/'' directory first.

==== Obtain Definitions ====

  * Use the ''./scripts/feeds update -a'' command to obtain package definitions. 
  * After the definitions have been updates, execute ''./scripts/feeds install <packagename>'' to prepare the package and its dependencies.

==== Compile Packages ====
After the Makefile is in place, the usual buildroot commands apply:

  * ''make package///example///download'' - download the soures of //example//
  * ''make package///example///prepare'' - extract the sources, apply patches and download if necessary
  * ''make package///example///compile'' - compile //example//, prepare and download if necessary
  * ''make package///example///clean'' - clean the sourcecode
  * ''make package/index'' - build a repository index to make the output directory usable as local //opkg// source

Some packages are built on host:

| ''$ make package///example///host/{clean,compile} V=99'' |

The common command to recompile a package //example// and enable verbose output is:

| ''$ make package///example///{clean,compile} V=99'' |

After the compilation is finished, the generated .ipk files are placed in the bin directory.

The output of make might contain ''WARNING: your configuration is out of sync. Please run make menuconfig, oldconfig or defconfig!''. That warning is misleading and wrong in the SDK case. Since everything is precompiled you cannot run oldconfig (see [[https://forum.openwrt.org/viewtopic.php?id=43055|Why is the SDK configuration out of sync?]]).

===== Troubleshooting =====

:!: Some SDK versions have bugs.
