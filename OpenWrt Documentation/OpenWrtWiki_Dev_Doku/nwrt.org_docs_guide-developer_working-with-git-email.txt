====== Sending patches by git send-email ======

Send an email to the [[https://lists.openwrt.org/mailman/listinfo/openwrt-devel|development mailing list]]. All patches need to be sent in the same format as those that are listed on [[https://patchwork.ozlabs.org/project/openwrt/list/|patchwork]]. If the patch does not get listed in patchwork then it won't get processed.

Using [[https://git-scm.com/docs/git-send-email|git send-email]] is warmly recommended, as email clients tend to add spaces and screw up the formatting or add non-printable characters.
