====== System configuration /etc/config/system ======
The system UCI subsystem configuration file is located in ''/etc/config/system''.

===== System section =====
The ''system'' section contains settings that apply to the most basic operation of the system, such as the hostname, the time zone, and how and where to write logging information to. The default settings are:

<code bash>
# uci -N show system.@system[0]
system.@system[0]=system
system.@system[0].hostname='OpenWrt'
system.@system[0].timezone='UTC'
system.@system[0].ttylogin='0'
system.@system[0].log_size='64'
system.@system[0].urandom_seed='0'
</code>

These options can be set in the system section:

<sortable>
^ Name ^ Type ^ Required ^ Default ^ Description ^
| ''hostname'' | string | no | ''OpenWrt'' | The hostname for this system. Avoid points, even if they are within quotes. For example ' ''my.hostname'' ' will show only the ' ''my'' ' part |
| ''buffersize'' | integer | no | kernel specific | Size of the kernel message buffer. |
| ''conloglevel'' | integer | no | ''7'' | Number between 1-8. The maximum log level for kernel messages to be logged to the console. Only messages with a level lower than this will be printed to the console. Higher level messages have lower log level number. Highest level messages are ones with log level 0. If you want more verbose messages in console put conloglevel to 8 if you want less messages lower conloglevel to 4 or even less.\\ Note that in releases 17.x and later this and similar parameters may have [[https://forum.openwrt.org/t/logd-doesnt-honor-conloglevel-17-01-4-r3560-79f57e422d/8196|no effect]]. |
| ''cronloglevel'' | integer | no | ''5'' | The minimum level for cron messages to be logged to syslog. ''0'' will print all debug messages, ''8'' will log command executions, and ''9'' or higher will only log error messages. |
| ''klogconloglevel'' | integer | no | ''7'' | The maximum log level for kernel messages to be logged to the console. Only messages with a level lower than this will be printed to the console. Identical to ''conloglevel'' and will override it. |
| ''log_buffer_size'' | integer | no | //(none)// | Size of the log buffer of the procd based system log, that is accessible via the ''logread'' command. Defaults to the value of ''log_size'' if unset. |
| ''log_file'' | string | no | no log file | File to write log messages to (type ''file''). The default is to not write a log in a file. The most often used location for a system log file is ''/var/log/messages''. |
| ''log_hostname'' | string | no | //(none)// | Hostname to send to remote syslog. If none is provided, the actual hostname is send. This feature is only present in 17.xx and later versions |
| ''log_ip'' | IP address | no | //(none)// | IP address of a syslog server to which the log messages should be sent in addition to the local destination. |
| ''log_port'' | integer | no | ''514'' | Port number of the remote syslog server specified with ''log_ip''. |
| ''log_prefix'' | string | no | //(none)// | Adds a prefix to all log messages send over network. |
| ''log_proto'' | string | no | ''udp'' | Sets the protocol to use for the connection, either ''tcp'' or ''udp''. |
| ''log_remote'' | bool | no | ''1'' | Enables remote logging. |
| ''log_size'' | integer | no | ''64'' | Size of the file based log buffer in KiB (see ''log_file''). This value is used as the fallback value for ''log_buffer_size'' if the latter is not specified. |
| ''log_trailer_null'' | bool | no | ''0'' | Use ''\0'' instead of ''\n'' as trailer when using TCP. |
| ''log_type'' | string | no | ''circular'' | Either ''circular'' or ''file''. |
| ''ttylogin'' | bool | no | ''0'' | Require authentication for local users to log in the system. Disabled by default. It applies to the access methods listed in ''/etc/inittab'', such as keyboard and serial. |
| ''urandom_seed'' | string | no | ''0'' | Path of the seed. Enables saving a new seed on each boot. |
| ''timezone'' | string | no | ''UTC'' | The time zone that date and time should be rendered in by default.\\ See [[https://github.com/openwrt/luci/blob/master/modules/luci-base/luasrc/sys/zoneinfo/tzdata.lua|timezone database]], e.g. ''%%zonename="Europe/London"%%'' and ''%%timezone="GMT0BST,M3.5.0/1,M10.5.0"%%''. |
| ''zonename'' | string | no | ''UTC'' | Only useful when using glibc and zoneinfo! FIXME: Is this really true? IIRC musl supports zoneinfo as well (but the zoneinfo packages are still needed) at least for 17.xx and later series (''LIBC_USE_EGLIBC'', ''PACKAGE_zoneinfo-*'') The time zone that date and time should be rendered in by default. Suppose you want to use Brussels' timezone, set this value to ''Europe/Brussels''. Possible values can be found by running ''find /usr/share/zoneinfo''. |
