====== fw3 Reference Network Topology ======
This is the network topology used as a common reference for most configurations for this section.

Starting from the top of the diagram is the public internet.  The network has a
single public IPv4 address leased from Verizon ($5US/month) terminating on a
Verizon [[http://www.mocalliance.org|Multimedia over Coax Alliance (MoCA)]]
router.  This router handles the telephones, video set top boxes and
internet access (triple play).  There is a single GigE 802.3 interface to the
**MAIN** router for all internal wired and wireless internet access.

:!: Interestingly, the Verizon MoCA router runs on an ARM926 using the jungo ''openrq'' 
firmware, based on Linux 2.6.16.  jungo appears to have been purchased by cisco systems
many years ago; cisco is now selling 
[[https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/video/videoscape-openrg/index.html|openrq]].
It looks like Verizon has been limping along without developer support since then...

Now on to more recent technology...

The router switch in
**MAIN** is configured to bridge all LAN-side traffic as the default ''br-lan'' interface
on the ''192.16.3.0/24'' network.  See
[[docs:guide-user:firewall:fw3_network#lan-bridge|lan bridge]] for a description of this.
**MAIN** handles all the internal stations using the 
''192.168.3.0/24'' network, mostly WLAN stations but several wired ethernet
stations for printing and NAS.
In the firewall test network:
  * **MAIN** is the OpenWrt production router,
  * **STA1** is a linux laptop from where most of testing is initiated,
  * **DUT** is the OpenWrt ''Device Under Test'' router wired to one of the **MAIN** 802.3 ethernet ports,
  * **STA2** is a linux laptop,
  * **STA3** and **STA4** are 802.11 wifi devices (tablet, phone, etc.)
  * **STA-server1** is a linux server wired to a DUT 802.3 ethernet port in vlan 102,
  * **STA-server2** is a linux desktop wired to a DUT 802.3 ethernet port in vlan 103.

Unless otherwise noted, an IPv4 address is assigned using DHCP.

**MAIN** is provisioned with a static lease added for **DUT** so the **DUT**
will always gets the same IP address: ''192.168.3.11''.  Static routes to the
**DUT** network(s) must also be added to the **MAIN** routing table so **STA1** can
communicate with devices in vlan 102 and vlan 103.  
See [[docs:guide-user:network:ipv4:start|ipv4 configuration]]
for provisioning static routes.

The **DUT** is configured with two VLANs. ''eth0.102'' is a lan bridge using
the ''192.168.10.0/24'' network for basic firewall testing.
''eth0.103'' has a single wired ethernet port using the ''192.168.30.0/24'' network for
[[docs:guide-user:firewall:fw3_configurations:fw3_dmz|DMZ]] testing.

The reference topology allows firewall rules to be modified on
the **DUT** in a sandbox without exposing it to the Internet;
only **MAIN** LAN-side stations can access the **DUT**.
Of secondary importantce, firewall rule testing has little probability of
causing complete comms loss from **STA1** to the **DUT**
(but it can still happen if I really hose the firewall rule set!)

:!: Generally the policy is set to ACCEPT for LAN to WAN so all traffic
initiated from the LAN-side is forwarded.  In our topology, the policy is set to
REJECT, so a firewall rule must be explicitly added for each service from LAN
to WAN (e.g. ICMP, SSH, HTTP).  This results in less confusion
when a packet is forwarded but is expected to be rejected or dropped.
