this feature was removed


You've [[docs:guide-user:luci:luci_app_statistics|configured luci-app-statistics]] to your liking and now you want to share the charts.

One way is to serve them via LuCI but without authentication:
  - create ''/usr/lib/lua/luci/controller/public_stats.lua'' with the following content:\\ <code>
module("luci.controller.public_stats", package.seeall)

function index()
    assign({"graph"}, {"admin", "statistics", "graph"}, nil)
end</code>
  - wipe out some caches that are now stale: ''rm -rf /tmp/luci-indexcache /tmp/luci-modulecache/''
  - log out from LuCI if you're still logged in
  - visit http://192.168.1.1/cgi-bin/luci/graph
  - add ''/usr/lib/lua/luci/controller/public_stats.lua'' to ''/etc/sysupgrade.conf'' so it survives upgrades


"Graph" will now appear in the page footer, including on the login page, so you shouldn't need a custom index.

Another way might be to use a ''collectd'' network output plugin and log the data to a more powerful remote host running something like Cacti.
