====== IPv6 theory ======

  - read about [[wp>OSI_model]] and understand that Internet_Protocol has two current versions, v4 and v6.
  - we (and other participants in the Internet) won't simply switch from IPv4 to IPv6 but (try) to run both simultaneously, technically //dual stack//
  - a couple of [[wp>IPv6 transition mechanisms]] exist

Following components of your GNU/Linux distribution (OpenWrt) must be or become or made IPv6 compliant:
  - kernel? (or just the network stack?)
  - network stack
  - wlan stack
  - netfilter
  - programs

Furthermore both protocols have to work simultaneously.
