Explanations for the average person:
  * This Video: [[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5KPryOHwk8|YT 41minutes]] at Time point ~ 21:00 explains CoDel
  * it also explains [[docs:guide-user:network:traffic-shaping:sch_fq_codel|Fair Queue CoDel]]
  * but is does not explain [[docs:guide-user:network:traffic-shaping:sch_hfsc|HFSC]]!!!


  * measure the latency in the queue (from ingress to egress, via time stamping on entry and checking the timestamp on exit
  * when latency exceeds tartget, think about dropping a packet
  * after latency exceeds target, drop a packet at the HEAD of the queue (not the tail!)
  * if that does not fix it, after a shorter interval (inverse sqrt), drop the net packet sooner, again at the HEAD
  * keep decreasing the interval between drops until the latency in the queue drops below target
  * we start with 100ms at the interval of the estimate and 5ms as the target (for 4Mbit/s and up) 10Gbig/s needs a smaller target.
  * below 4Mbit/s ... well, we don't know
