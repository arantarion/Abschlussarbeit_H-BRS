====== Wi-Fi /etc/config/wireless ======
The wireless radio UCI configuration is located in **///etc/config/wireless//**.

If the device has ethernet ports, the wireless is turned **OFF** by default.
You can turn it on in ''/etc/config/wireless'' by changing ''//option disabled '1'//'' to ''//option disabled '0'//'' (commenting out the line or removing it is sufficient).

===== Sections =====
A typical wireless config file contains at least a pair of:
  * //wifi device// (specifying general radio properties like channel, driver type and txpower)
  * //wifi interface// (defining a wireless network on top of the //wifi device//).

===== Wi-Fi devices =====
The //wifi-device// refer to physical radio devices present on the system.
The options present in this section describe properties common across all wireless interfaces on this radio device, such as channel or antenna selection.

A minimal //wifi-device// declaration may look like the example below.
Note that identifiers and options may vary for different chipset types or drivers.

<code bash>
config	wifi-device	'wl0'
	option	type	'broadcom'
	option	channel	'6'
</code>

  * //wl0// is the //internal identifier// for the wireless adapter
  * //broadcom// specifies the //chipset/driver type//
  * //6// is the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_WLAN_channels|wireless channel]] the device operates on

The possible options for device sections are listed in the table below.
Note that not all options are used for all chipset/driver types, refer to the comments for further details.

| //owe_transition_bssid// | BSSID address | no | //none// | Opportunistic Wireless Encryption (OWE) Transition BSSID (only for OPEN and OWE networks) |

==== WPA Modes ====
Besides the WPA mode, the //encryption// option also specifies the group and peer ciphers to use.
To override the cipher, the value of //encryption// must be given in the form //mode+cipher//.
See the listing below for possible combinations.
If the //hwmode// of the interface is set to //ng// or //na//, then the //CCMP// cipher is always added to the list.

To use the WPA3 modes as access point, it is required to install the ''hostapd-openssl'' package.

To use the WPA3 modes as station (client), it is required to install the ''wpa-supplicant-openssl'' package.

To support both access point and station modes with WPA3, it is possible to install the ''wpad-openssl'' package.

==== WPA key reinstallation attack workaround ====
^ Name ^ Default ^ Description ^
| //wpa_disable_eapol_key_retries// | //0// | Workaround for key reinstallation attacks (requires LEDE 17.01.4 or higher) |

Complete description copied from upstream hostapd.conf example:

<code bash>
# Workaround for key reinstallation attacks
#
# This parameter can be used to disable retransmission of EAPOL-Key frames that
# are used to install keys (EAPOL-Key message 3/4 and group message 1/2). This
# is similar to setting wpa_group_update_count=1 and
# wpa_pairwise_update_count=1, but with no impact to message 1/4 and with
# extended timeout on the response to avoid causing issues with stations that
# may use aggressive power saving have very long time in replying to the
# EAPOL-Key messages.
#
# This option can be used to work around key reinstallation attacks on the
# station (supplicant) side in cases those station devices cannot be updated
# for some reason. By removing the retransmissions the attacker cannot cause
# key reinstallation with a delayed frame transmission. This is related to the
# station side vulnerabilities CVE-2017-13077, CVE-2017-13078, CVE-2017-13079,
# CVE-2017-13080, and CVE-2017-13081.
#
# This workaround might cause interoperability issues and reduced robustness of
# key negotiation especially in environments with heavy traffic load due to the
# number of attempts to perform the key exchange is reduced significantly. As
# such, this workaround is disabled by default (unless overridden in build
# configuration). To enable this, set the parameter to 1.
#wpa_disable_eapol_key_retries=1
</code>

**Note** that this workaround can't prevent attacks against Tunneled Direct-Link Setup (TDLS).
You may also want to add the option //tdls_prohibit=1// in order to make such an attack more complicated:
^ Name ^ Default ^ Description ^
| //tdls_prohibit// | //0// | Prohibit the use of TDLS on the network (complicates key reinstallation attacks against TDLS) (requires hostapd/wpad 2016-12-19-ad02e79d-7 or higher) |

==== WPS options ====
Listing of [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi_Protected_Setup|Wi-Fi Protected Setup]] related options.

:!: Support for WPS is provided by packages //wpad// and //hostapd-utils//.
Default package //wpad-mini// is not enough.

:!: WPS is possible only when encryption PSK/PSK2 is selected.

^ Name ^ Type ^ Required ^ Default ^ Description ^
| //wps_config// | list | no | //(none)// | List of configuration methods. Currentlly supported methods are: //push_button//. |
| //wps_device_name// | string | no | //LEDE AP// | User-friendly description of device; up to 32 octets encoded in UTF-8. |
| //wps_device_type// | string | no | //6-0050F204-1// | Primary device type. Examples: //1-0050F204-1// (Computer / PC), //1-0050F204-2// (Computer / Server), //5-0050F204-1// (Storage / NAS), //6-0050F204-1// (Network Infrastructure / AP)|
| //wps_label// | boolean| no | //0// | Enable //label// configuration method. |
| //wps_manufacturer// | string | no | //lede-project.org// | The manufacturer of the device (up to 64 ASCII characters). |
| //wps_pushbutton// | boolean| no | //0// | Enable //push-button// configuration method. |
| //wps_pin// | string | no | none | The PIN to use with WPS-PIN (only in external registrar mode?) |

Minimal steps needed to get WPS running:

  * Add //option wps_pushbutton '1// ' to a //config wifi-iface// section that is configured for WPA2-PSK in /etc/config/wireless
  * opkg update
  * opkg remove wpad-mini
  * opkg install wpad hostapd-utils
  * reboot

After rebooting, instead of pushing the WPS button, you can manually initiate the WPS process (which is safer than using the button if it doubles as a reset button):

<code bash>
hostapd_cli wps_pbc
</code>

When using WPS-PIN:
  * Add //option wps_label '1// ' to a //config wifi-iface// section that is configured for WPA2-PSK in /etc/config/wireless
  * opkg update
  * opkg remove wpad-mini
  * opkg install wpad hostapd-utils
  * reboot

After rebooting, the WPS PIN needs to be given to hostapd each time a station tries to connect.
The PIN may **NOT** be used multiple times, as an active attacker can recover half of it during each try.
The "any" keyword can be replaced by the specific stations EUUID, as printed in hostapd log.

<code bash>
hostapd_cli wps_pin any $PIN
</code>

Example:

<code bash>
# /etc/config/wireless
...
config wifi-iface
	option device 'radio0'
	option mode 'ap'
	option ssid 'My-WiFi-Home'
	option network 'lan'
	option encryption 'psk2'
	option key 'WiFipassword'
	option ieee80211w '0'
	option wps_pushbutton '1'
</code>

===== Start/Stop wireless =====
Wireless interfaces are brought up and down with the //wifi// command. To (re)start the wireless after a configuration change, use //wifi//, to disable the wireless, run //wifi down//. In case your platform carries multiple wireless devices it is possible to start or run down each of them individually by making the //wifi// command be followed by the device name as a second parameter. Note: The //wifi// command has an optional first parameter that defaults to //up// , i.e. start the device. To make the second parameter indeed a second parameter it is mandatory to give a first parameter which can be anything except //down//. E.g. to start the interface //wlan2// issue: //wifi up wlan2//; to stop that interface: //wifi down wlan2//. If the platform has also e.g. wlan0 and wlan1 these will not be touched by stopping or starting wlan2 selectively.

===== Regenerate configuration =====
To rebuild the configuration file, e.g. after installing a new wireless driver, remove the existing wireless configuration (if any) and use the //wifi config// command:

<code bash>
rm -f /etc/config/wireless
wifi config
</code>

===== htmode: the Wi-Fi channel width =====
The Wi-Fi channel width is the range of frequencies i.e. how broad the signal is for transferring data.
Generally speaking, the bigger the channel width, the more data can be transmitted over the signal.
But as with everything there are drawbacks.
With larger channel widths, interference with others Wi-Fi networks or Bluetooth becomes a much larger issue, and making solid connections becomes much harder as well.
Think of it like a highway.
The wider the road, the more traffic (data) can pass through.
On the other hand, the more cars (routers) you have on the road, the more congested the traffic becomes.

Wi-Fi standard allows 10, 20, 22, 40, 80 and 160 MHz but 10MHz is not used anymore, the 80 and 160 can be used only with 5 GHz frequency, and certain devices not being able to connect to APs with channel widths more than 40Mhz.

By default, the 2.4 GHz frequency uses a 20 MHz channel width.
A 20MHz channel width is wide enough to span one channel.
A 40 MHz channel width bonds two neighbouring 20 MHz channels together, forming a 40 MHz channel width; therefore, it allows for greater speed and faster transfer rates.
One "control" channel functions as the main channel, and the other "extension" as the auxiliary channel.
The main channel sends Beacon packets and data packets, and the auxiliary channel sends other packets.
The extension channel can either be "above" or "below" the control channel, as long as it doesn't go outside the band.
For example, if your control channel is 1, your extension channel has to "above", because anything below channel 1 would be below the lowest frequency allowed in the 2.4GHz ISM band.
The extension channel has to be contiguous with the edge of the control channel, without overlapping.

''HT40+'' means that centre frequency of the main 20 MHz channel is higher than that of the auxiliary channel, and ''HT40-'' otherwise.
For example, if the centre frequency 149 and the centre frequency 153 reside on two 20 MHz channels, 149plus indicates that the two 20 MHz channels are bundled to form a 40 MHz channel.

When the HT40 mode is used in the 2.4 GHz frequency band, there is only one non-overlapping channel.
Therefore, you are not advised to use the HT40 mode in the 2.4 GHz frequency band.

  * ''HT20'' High Throughput 20MHz, 802.11n
  * ''HT40'' High Throughput 40MHz, 802.11n
  * ''HT40-'' High Throughput 40MHz, 802.11n, control channel is bellow extension channel.
  * ''HT40+'' High Throughput 40MHz, 802.11n, control channel is above extension channel.
  * ''VHT20'' Very High Throughput 20MHz, Supported by 802.11ac
  * ''VHT40'' Very High Throughput 40MHz, Supported by 802.11ac
  * ''VHT80'' Very High Throughput 80MHz, Supported by 802.11ac
  * ''VHT160'' Very High Throughput 160MHz, Supported by 802.11ac
  * ''NOHT'' disables 11n

==== 40 MHz channel width (up to 300 Mbps) for 802.11n devices ONLY ====
The default max channel width ''VT20'' i.e. 20MHz supports a max speed of 150Mbps.
Increasing this to 40MHz will increase the maximum theoretical speed to 300Mbps.
The catch is that in areas with a lot of Wi-Fi traffic (and Bluetooth etc. which share the same radio frequencies), 40MHz may decrease your overall speed.
Devices **should** detect interference when using 40MHz, and drop back to 20MHz.
Edit ''htmode'' options in the file ''/etc/config/wireless'' and restart the Wi-Fi AP to test various channel widths.
Note that option //htmode// should be set to either ''HT40+'' (for channels 1-7) or ''HT40-'' (for channels 5-11) or simply ''HT40''.

===== DFS / radar detection =====
In many countries, operating Wi-Fi devices on some or all channels in the 5GHz band requires radar detection and [[docs:techref:dfs|DFS]] [[http://wifi-insider.com/wlan/dfs.htm|(explanation)]].
If you define a channel in your wireless config that requires DFS according to your country regulations, the 5GHz radio device won’t start up unless the firmware image is able to provide DFS support (i.e. it is both included and enabled).
More technical details of the Linux implementation can be found [[https://wireless.wiki.kernel.org/en/developers/DFS|here]].
DFS works as follows in Linux: The driver detects radar pulses and reports this to nl80211 where the information is processed.
If a series of pulses matches one of the defined radar patterns, this will be reported to the user space application (e.g. hostapd) which in turn reacts by switching to another channel.

The following configuration selects channel 104 which needs DFS support as implicitly stated with country code DE:

<code bash>
config	wifi-device		'radio0'
	option	type		'mac80211'
	option	channel		'104'
	option	hwmode		'11a'
	option	path		'pci0000:00/0000:00:00.0'
	option	htmode		'HT20'
	option	country		'DE'

config	wifi-iface
	option	device		'radio0'
	option	network		'lan'
	option	mode		'ap'
	option	ssid		'OpenWrt'
	option	encryption	'none'
</code>

You can check the country (regulatory domain) your Wi-Fi card thinks it must conform to with

<code bash>
iw reg get
</code>

If in doubt, double check your hostapd-phy.conf to make sure it contains the following values, and that your country code is set:

<code bash>
country_code=DE
ieee80211n=1
ieee80211d=1
ieee80211h=1
hw_mode=a
</code>

If radar detection is working, DFS channels will show up like this (here for Belgium, //iw phy1 info// output trimmed):

<code>
Frequencies:
* 5220 MHz [44] (17.0 dBm)
* 5240 MHz [48] (17.0 dBm)
* 5260 MHz [52] (20.0 dBm) (radar detection)
DFS state: usable (for 2155257 sec)
DFS CAC time: 60000 ms
* 5280 MHz [56] (20.0 dBm) (radar detection)
DFS state: usable (for 2155257 sec)
DFS CAC time: 60000 ms
</code>

:!: When DFS is on, there will be a delay before the interface is enabled (e.g. after reboot).
During this time period (often 60 seconds, and determined by local reglations) luci will report the interface is disabled.
This time period is used to detect the presence of other signals on the channel (Channel Availability Check Time).
This process can be monitored with:

<code bash>
logread -f
</code>

If you select a channel that requires DFS in your country and enable HT40, this may result in the **DFS start_dfs_cac() failed** error (visible with logread):

<code>
Configuration file: /var/run/hostapd-phy1.conf
wlan1: interface state UNINITIALIZED->COUNTRY_UPDATE
wlan1: interface state COUNTRY_UPDATE->HT_SCAN
wlan1: interface state HT_SCAN->DFS
wlan1: DFS-CAC-START freq=5680 chan=136 sec_chan=-1, width=0, seg0=0, seg1=0, cac_time=60s
DFS start_dfs_cac() failed, -1
Interface initialization failed
wlan1: interface state DFS->DISABLED
wlan1: AP-DISABLED
hostapd_free_hapd_data: Interface wlan1 wasn't started
</code>

Changing your configuration to HT20 should resolve this.
