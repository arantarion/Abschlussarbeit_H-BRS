====== DC overview ======
DC (Direct Connect) and [[wp>Advanced Direct Connect|ADC (Advanced Direct Connect)]] are both [[wp>Communications protocol]]s.
  * Official specifications for the DC protocol were never released, but there is a lot of FOSS utilizing the protocol; see here: [[wp>Direct_Connect_(file_sharing)#Protocol|WP]], here: [[http://wiki.ptokax.ch/doku.php/misc/dcprotocol/intro|ptokax wiki]], or ...
  * For the ADC protocol there are official specifications at: http://adc.sourceforge.net/ADC.html
  * The Wikipedia maintains an [[wp>Comparison_of_NMDC_Software|overview]] over available software for server (called hubs) and clients supporting the DC/ADC protocols
