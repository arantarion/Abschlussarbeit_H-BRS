====== DDNS Client DuckDNS ======
  * Following the link under the "Hints" header can show you if there are any changes that might be helpful, including features that aren't always present in busybox.
  * Installing the "ca-certificates" package will automatically add a general collection of certificates to the directory ''/etc/ssl/certs/'' and enables verification of SSL certificates by any program that uses this as a default, including ddns-scripts.

===== Changes =====
The smallest set of changes making the biggest difference are:
<file uci>
	#option service_name	"duckdns.org"
	option interface	"wan"	#assuming wan is the public network
	option domain		"<subdomain>.duckdns.org"
	option username		"<subdomain>"
	option update_url	"http://www.duckdns.org/update?domains=[USERNAME]&token=[PASSWORD]&ip=[IP]"
	option use_https	"1" #uses /etc/ssl/certs/ (populated by "ca-certificates"), or "option cacert"
</file>
  * Remove the ''service_name'' option, which is mutually exclusive with ''update_url'', and not specified for service ([[https://github.com/openwrt/packages/blob/master/net/ddns-scripts/files/services|IPv4]] and  [[https://github.com/openwrt/packages/blob/master/net/ddns-scripts/files/services_ipv6|IPv6]]) "duckdns.org"
  * The ''interface'' option tells ddns to update when this network changes status, namely when it goes up.
  * The ''domain'' option is the domain held by the client, and '''nslookup $DOMAIN%%'%%'' should succeed and point to the client (or router it's behind) when everything is up to date; this is used as the check to see if ''$DOMAIN'' points to the clients public IP.
  * The ''username'' option is used where the ''domain'' option was used before, this is also reflected in the change to ''update_url''
  * Turning on https, because encryption is our friend.

===== Full File =====
Replace ''<subdomain>'' and ''<duckdns-token>'' with proper values.

<file uci|/etc/config/ddns>
config service "duckdns"
	option enabled		'1'
	option interface	'wan'
	option username		'<subdomain>'
	option domain		'<subdomain>.duckdns.org'
	option password		'<duckdns-token>'
	option ip_source	'network'
	option ip_network	'wan'
	option check_interval	'1'
	option check_unit	'hours'
	option update_url	'http://www.duckdns.org/update?domains=[USERNAME]&token=[PASSWORD]&ip=[IP]'
	option use_https	'1'
</file>

This will update anytime the 'wan' network goes up, or the check (every hour) notices an inconsistency, and will force the ip to the value detected on the 'wan' network (remove the ''&ip=[IP]'' and duckdns will auto-detect). The 'force_interval' and 'force_unit' options are unnecessary as duckdns does not expire listings if they aren't refreshed periodically.
