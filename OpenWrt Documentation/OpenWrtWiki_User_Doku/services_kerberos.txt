====== Kerberos Server HowTo ======
Kerberos is a network authentication protocol which works on the basis of "tickets" to allow nodes communicating over a non-secure network to prove their identity to one another in a secure manner. (Source [[wp>Kerberos_(protocol)]])

===== Preparation =====

==== Prerequisites ====
Please read about here [[wp>Kerberos_(protocol)]] and especially [[http://www.kerberos.org/software/adminkerberos.pdf|Kerberos How-to]].

==== Required Packages ====
=== Server (OpenWrt) ===
  ***''krb5-server''**
    ***''krb5-libs''** (dependency of //krb5-server//)

=== Client (OpenWrt) ===
  ***''krb5-client''**

===== Installation =====
[[docs:guide-user:additional-software:opkg]]
<code bash>
opkg install krb5-server
</code>

===== Configuration =====
==== Server configuration ====
Create the file ''/etc/krb5.conf'' with the following credentials. Example:
<code>
[libdefaults]
    default_realm = YOURDOMAIN.ORG
    dns_lookup_realm = false
    dns_lookup_kdc = false
    ticket_lifetime = 24h
    forwardable = yes

[realms]
    YOURDOMAIN.ORG = {
        kdc = server_address_of_this_machine:88
        admin_server = server_address_of_this_machine:749
        default_domain = yourdomain.org
    }

[domain_realm]
    .yourdomain.org = YOURDOMAIN.ORG
    yourdomain.org = YOURDOMAIN.ORG
</code>

Replace **YOURDOMAIN.ORG** / **yourdomain.org** with the domain name of your domain the server should act for (names must be specified in UPPER- / lowercase as shown above). Replace **server_address_of_this_machine** with the host name/IP adress of this server you're setting up.

==== Starting the server ====

Start the server by issuing 
<code>/etc/init.d/krb5kdc start</code>

This should create the /etc/krb5kdc/ directory with the following files
<code>
-rw-------    1 root     root         8192 Feb 13 11:17 principal
-rw-------    1 root     root         8192 Feb 13 09:12 principal.kadm5
-rw-------    1 root     root            0 Feb 13 09:12 principal.kadm5.lock
-rw-------    1 root     root            0 Feb 13 11:17 principal.ok
</code>

In case you don't get any error messages check your server by logging on with <code>kadmin.local</code>

In case everything works well you will see the following message
<code>
root@bridge:~# kadmin.local
Authenticating as principal xxxxxxx/admin@YOURDOMAIN.ORG with password.
kadmin.local:
</code>

==== Testing the server ====

Perform the tests as described in the [[http://www.kerberos.org/software/adminkerberos.pdf|Kerberos How-to]] document on page 16/17.

===== Start on boot =====
To enable/disable automatic start on boot:\\
<code>/etc/init.d/krb5kdc enable</code>  this simply creates a symlink: ''/etc/rc.d/S60krb5kdc -> /etc/init.d/krb5kdc''\\
<code>/etc/init.d/krb5kdc disable</code> this removes the symlink again\\
