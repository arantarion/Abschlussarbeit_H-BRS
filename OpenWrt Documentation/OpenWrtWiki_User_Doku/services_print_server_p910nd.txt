====== p910nd ======
Description for the UCI configuration file ''/etc/config/p910nd''.

For installations instructions and more see: [[docs:guide-user:services:print_server:p910nd.server]].
You can run more than one printer at the same time by adding additional sections.

The default configuration is (list all configured printers):

<code bash>
uci show p910nd
</code>

===== Configuration =====
Description of the options in the p910nd config file ''/etc/config/p910nd'':

^ Option ^ Type ^ Default ^ Description ^
| ''enabled'' | boolean | ''0'' | ''1'': Enable the printer; ''0'': Disable the printer | 
| ''device'' | device path | /dev/usb/lp0 | The device your printer is connected to (e.g. ''/dev/usb/lp0'', ''/dev/printers/0'' for LPT under Linux 2.4; ''/dev/lp0'' for USB under Linux 2.6) | 
| ''port'' | number (0-9) | ''0'' | The p910nd listening TCP port (9100 + //port//) | 
| ''bidirectional'' | boolean | ''1'' | ''1'': Turn on bidirectional copying; ''0'': Turn off bidirectional copying | 
| ''bind'' | IP address | unknown | The IP address to listen on (typically the same as LAN)| 

**Note:** Enabling the service might not work as expected (not starting the service at boot time) on current Barrier Breaker versions (as of 2014.05.13), see [[https://dev.openwrt.org/ticket/14909|this issue]].

===== Example =====
<code bash>
# Add a printer
uci -q delete p910nd.prn1
uci set p910nd.prn1=p910nd
uci set p910nd.prn1.device=/dev/usb/lp1
uci set p910nd.prn1.port=1
uci set p910nd.prn1.bidirectional=1
uci set p910nd.prn1.enabled=1
uci commit p910nd
/etc/init.d/p910nd restart

# Delete the printer prn1
uci delete p910nd.prn1
uci commit p910nd
/etc/init.d/p910nd restart
</code>

  * Under Linux 2.4, the device name for the printer would be of the form /dev/usb/lpn, where n is usually 0 for the first printer.
  * Under Linux 2.6, the device name for the printing would be of the form /dev/lpn
