====== Shadowsocks ======

Here's a summary on how to install and setup shadowsocks on a fresh OpenWrt 19.06 installation, (taken from [[https://forum.openwrt.org/t/guide-shadowsocks-setup-on-openwrt-for-beginners/77026|this forum post]])

===== Installation =====

you need to install the following packages

<code> opkg install shadowsocks-libev-ss-local shadowsocks-libev-ss-redir shadowsocks-libev-ss-rules shadowsocks-libev-ss-tunnel</code> 

and if you need the Luci web interface also

<code> opkg install luci-app-shadowsocks-libev</code> 

===== Server Configuration =====
In the Luci Web UI, head to **Services > Shadowsocks-libev > Remote Servers** if going from CLI the config file is **/etc/config/shadowsocks-libev** 

Edit the existing sss0 server (or add a new one). Set at least IP, port, method and password, and don't forget to untick the Disable checkbox.

===== Services and Rules Configuration =====
The simplest recipe is to forward all traffic through the tunnel. Follow the steps outlined [[https://github.com/openwrt/packages/blob/master/net/shadowsocks-libev/README.md#recipes|in the readme file under Recipes > forward all]]

===== DNS Configuration =====
This must be done via command line according to the instructions in [[https://github.com/openwrt/packages/blob/master/net/shadowsocks-libev/README.md#recipes|in the readme file under Recipes > forward all]]
