====== VPN 概览 ======
就像 [[docs:guide-user:firewall:fw3_configurations:fw3_dmz|DMZ]]一样， [[wp>Virtual private network|VPN]]是一个security相关的概念, 它并不是一个协议（比如ssh），也不是一个特定的软件包,
在两个或者多个主机间设置VPN，可以使用的软件包有很多种。它们都使用[[wp>Client–server model|Client-Server concept]]，并且互相之间通常**不**兼容.
查看下 [[wp>OSI model]]，你可以意识到加解密可以在通信协议栈的不同layer上进行.

如果你的硬件支持 [[docs:techref:hardware:cryptographic.hardware.accelerators|Cryptographic Hardware Acceleration]]，你需要确保它被你的OpenWrt版本支持，并且被使能了.

===== IPsec =====
  * Protocol: [[wp>IPsec]]
  * Free software: [[wp>strongSwan]], [[wp>Openswan]], [[wp>Racoon (KAME)|Racoon]]

strongSwan is a recommended IPsec implementation, though some of this documentation may be relevant for other configurations.

===== OpenVPN =====
  * Free software: [[wp>OpenVPN]]

{{pagequery>@docs:guide-user:services:vpn:openvpn *;sort=ns,title;hidestart;hidejump;display=title;bullet=square}}

===== OpenConnect =====
You may setup OpenWrt as an [[http://www.infradead.org/openconnect/|OpenConnect]] VPN client or server.
This is a protocol based on SSL/TLS and datagram TLS and is compatible with CISCO's AnyConnect SSL VPN.

  * Client side requirements:

    * [[https://github.com/openwrt/luci/tree/master/protocols/luci-proto-openconnect|luci-proto-openconnect]]

  * Server side requirements:

    * [[https://github.com/openwrt/luci/tree/master/applications/luci-ocserv|luci-app-ocserv]]
    * [[docs:guide-user:services:vpn:openconnect:server|A How-To for the server setup.]] Note: the instructions include comments on the Github advice which might not work for some. In addition, the instructions are for a FULL tunnel setup.

There are various [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenConnect#Platforms|openconnect clients]], including in GNOME NetworkManager, [[https://github.com/nmav/openconnect-gui/releases|Windows]], and [[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=app.openconnect|Android]].

===== PPTP =====
:!: Not secure!
PPTP is broken since 1997.
See [[http://poptop.sourceforge.net/dox/protocol-security.phtml|poptop security message]].
