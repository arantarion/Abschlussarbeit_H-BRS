====== Netcat as Webserver ======
[[wp>Netcat]]  is ...; manpage: [[man>netcat]]

As default OpenWrt installs
  * ''busybox-ash'' (that is the Busybox-fork of the Debian implementation of the [[wp>Almquist shell]] (see -> [[http://www.in-ulm.de/~mascheck/various/ash/#busybox]]). In case you want to read about it.)
  * ''busybox-nc'' (= the busybox implementation of netcat) does not support server mode.

You can anytime replace those packages by they original counterparts: <code bash>opkg install bash netcat</code>
